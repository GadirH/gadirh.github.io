summary: "In this project, we explored various logic gates and gained hands-on practice in using them to build basic digital circuits."

In this project, we explored the fundamental building blocks of digital electronics: logic gates. We worked with the five essential gates — NOT, AND, OR, XOR, and NAND — and learned how each one transforms input signals to create specific outputs.
We also practiced combining these gates to form small logic circuits, helping us understand how computers perform basic decision-making operations. This project strengthened our understanding of binary logic and the principles behind digital systems.
