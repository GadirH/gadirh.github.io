Hello, my name is **Gadir Hasanov**.

I’m a student who’s passionate about creating meaningful work, exploring new ideas, and constantly learning new skills. I enjoy taking on projects that challenge me to grow, think differently, and refine what I’m capable of.

This site is a place where I share the things I’m working on, the experiences that shape me, and the ideas that inspire my curiosity. Whether it’s creative work, personal projects, or something I’m currently learning, you’ll find pieces of my journey here.

Thanks for stopping by — I hope you find something here that interests or inspires you.
